# 🐛 Automated Bug Report Generator from Error Logs using n8n

An n8n workflow that automatically generates structured, professional bug reports from application error logs using AI (Groq LLM).

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

QA teams often receive daily error logs from monitoring systems and manually read through them to write bug reports — a repetitive and time-consuming process. This workflow automates that by using an LLM to analyze error logs and produce well-formatted bug reports instantly.

## 🔄 Workflow Overview

```
[Chat Trigger] → [AI Agent + System Prompt] → [Groq LLM (llama-3.3-70b-versatile)] → [Structured Bug Report Output]
```

| Node | Type | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| **When chat message received** | Chat Trigger | Accepts error log text as input via chat interface |
| **AI Agent** | LangChain Agent | Processes log using a QA Engineer system prompt |
| **Groq Chat Model** | LLM Sub-node | Uses `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` for fast, free inference |

## 📋 Bug Report Output Format

The workflow generates reports with the following structure:

- **Bug ID** — Auto-generated from log data
- **Title** — Concise summary of the error
- **Severity** — Critical / High / Medium / Low (with defined criteria)
- **Environment** — Service, timestamp, host, version
- **Description** — 2-3 sentence summary
- **Steps to Reproduce** — Extracted or inferred from log sequence
- **Expected Result** — What should have happened
- **Actual Result** — What actually happened (the error)
- **Error Details** — Key error message / stack trace
- **Possible Root Cause** — Only if evident from logs
- **Recommended Next Steps** — Actionable suggestions

## 🛡️ Anti-Hallucination Safeguard

The system prompt enforces strict rules:

> *"Use ONLY the log data provided. Do NOT invent, assume, or hallucinate any information. If any field cannot be determined from the log data, mark it as [UNKNOWN]."*

Temperature is set to **0.2** for consistent, factual output.

### Steps

1. **Download** the `Bug_Report_Generator_Workflow.json` file from this repository
2. **Import** into n8n: Go to **Workflows → Import from File** and select the JSON file
3. **Configure Groq credentials:**
   - Open the **Groq Chat Model** node
   - Click on **Credentials → Create New**
   - Paste your Groq API key
4. **Activate** the workflow
5. **Test it:** Click the **Chat** button in n8n and paste any error log text

## 💡 Example Usage

### Sample Input (Error Log)

```
[2026-02-28 09:15:42] ERROR PaymentService - Transaction failed for user_id=78432
  Exception: java.sql.SQLTransientConnectionException: HikariPool-1 - Connection is not available, request timed out after 30000ms
  at com.zaxxer.hikari.pool.HikariPool.createTimeoutException(HikariPool.java:695)
  at com.payment.service.ProcessPayment.execute(ProcessPayment.java:142)
  Database: payments_db_primary
  Active connections: 50/50
  Environment: production-us-east-1
```

### Sample Output

The AI Agent will generate a complete bug report with title like *"Payment Transaction Failure Due to Database Connection Pool Exhaustion"*, severity rated as **Critical**, and actionable next steps like investigating connection pool sizing and checking for connection leaks.

## 🛠️ Customization Ideas

- **Add a Slack/Email node** to send bug reports to your team channel automatically
- **Connect to Jira/Linear** to create tickets directly from generated reports
- **Add a Google Sheets node** to log all generated bug reports in a spreadsheet
- **Swap the LLM** — replace Groq with OpenAI, Anthropic, or Ollama
